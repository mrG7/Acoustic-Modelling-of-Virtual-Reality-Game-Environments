# Acoustic-Modelling-of-Virtual-Reality-Game-Environments
#### Graduate research project based on the modelling of acoustic spaces within virtual reality environments within the Unreal Engine
#### Author: Andrew Littleton

## Development Tools
- Unreal Engine 4.25.3 (Epic)
- Wwise 2019.2.6.7381
- Plugins Used: 
  1. TBD

## Research Topics
- From a computer science perspective, the goal of the project is to determine the most computationally efficient way to generate an accurate acosutic model of a virtual space. This can be applied to real physical spaces to be converted in to a virtual environment. 
- From an audio design perspective, the goal of the project will be to debate the merits of using acoustically accurate models for virtual reality game environments as this will help to produce greater immersion in that particular genre of immersive gaming.
